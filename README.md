### [^1]: The Citadel: 

> [!NOTE]
> The main area in which all the structures are located, which the player can control to destroy enemies.

### [^2]: The light source:

> [!NOTE]
> It is located in the lower part of the citadel in the center.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Continuously releases the beam in one direction (up).

### [^3]: Ray:

> [!NOTE]
> A beam of energy emitted from the light source needed to power the towers.

### [^4]: Reflectors:

> [!NOTE]
> The reflectors are located in slots and are designed to receive, change the direction and split the beam.

> [!TIP]
> Types of directions:
> - Up (0 degrees).
> - Right (90 degrees).
> - Down (180 degrees).
> - Left (270 degrees). 

### [^5]: Towers:

> [!NOTE]
> Structures to protect the gates of the citadel from enemies.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Towers need energy from the beam to function.

### [^6]: Types of towers:
 + The Sniper Tower
 + The Artillery Tower
 + The Deceleration Tower
 + The Freezing Tower
 + The Zip Tower

### [^7]: Gates: 
> The point at which the opponents move in the form of a gate, upon reaching which it takes away some lives.

### [^8]: Health (lives):
> The main resource that determines how many enemies can be passed through the gate before losing.

> [!TIP]
> When the life indicator drops to 0, the level is failed.

### [^9]: Enemies:
> Enemies (Mobs) appearing from spawn points and moving towards the gate.
The trajectory of movement to the gate depends on the spawn point at which the mob appeared and is set randomly (that is, mobs do not move linearly, but along a random trajectory).

### [^10]: Examples of mobs:
 + Spider
 + Ogre
 + Wolf
 + Bat

### [^11]: Wave:
> Basically, the element that determines the difficulty of the level, the higher the difficulty, the more waves and opponents there are in it.

### [^12]: Score:
> Points are added to the score counter for each enemy killed. The number of points depends on the enemy killed.
